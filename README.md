# PlayerPicker
This program is a personal-use application designed to generate lineups for fantasy sports events.  It functions by taking data from a website that predicts individual player performance, such as numberfire.com, and checks all possible combinations of players to find the one that is expected to perform the best.

Although multi-thread support was added for learning purposes, the application is bound by memory I/O and therefore usually performs worse with multiple threads than one.
